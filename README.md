Argentina Provinces, Localities and Municipalities API
This is a simple web application that uses the Argentina Provinces, Localities and Municipalities API to display a list of localities and municipalities for a selected province. The application consists of three files: index.html, script.js, and styles.css.

How to Use
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The user will be presented with a dropdown menu to select a province. Once a province is selected, the application will use the API to retrieve a list of localities for that province. The user can then select a locality from the second dropdown menu, and the application will retrieve a list of municipalities for that locality.
